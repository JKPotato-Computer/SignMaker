Version: 2.1

SignMaker is a JavaScript-based app for creating highway guide signs. Based off of [Kurumi's Sign Maker](http://www.kurumi.com/roads/signmaker). Allows for the creation of highway guide signs in the style defined by the United States FHWA in their [MUTCD](https://mutcd.fhwa.dot.gov/kno_2009r1r2.htm).

This version of SignMaker is an attempt to reproduce most of the sign mechanics used in the real world, including:

* The usage of the Clearview font (some states/provinces use Clearview on their signs)
* Realistic arrows (Uses PNGs of Arrows rather than fonts)
* Subpanels (multiple signs in one panel for advanced navigation)
* Advanced Exit Tabs (allow multiple exit tabs at once + more configuration)
* Two Shield Banners (allows the usage of more than one shield banner, future updates on positioning + type will be made)
* Panel Padding (make the infamous Katy Freeway signs)
* and more to come soon..
