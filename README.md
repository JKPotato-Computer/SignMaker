SignMaker is a JavaScript-based app for creating highway guide signs. Based off of [Kurumi's Sign Maker](http://www.kurumi.com/roads/signmaker). Allows for the creation of highway guide signs in the style defined by the United States FHWA in their [MUTCD](https://mutcd.fhwa.dot.gov/kno_2009r1r2.htm).

While the other versions (dki-os/SignMaker) and its forks do exist, this fork has more options that one could use, which includes:

* Clearview font (some states use Clearview on their signs)
* More Exit Only varients
* Better arrows
* Subpanels (multiple panels in a panel)
* Exit Tab Colors
* Updated settings menu
* Two banners
* and more to come soon..
